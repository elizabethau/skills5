# PART 3: NAVIGATING RELATIONSHIPS

# **Use SQLAlchemy relationships for each function**

# 1. Write a function, print_directory, which does not take any arguments
#    and prints out each human (once) with a list of their animals.
#
#    The output should look like this (with tabs to indent each animal name under
#    a human's name)
#
#       Human_first_name Human_last_name
#           Animal name (animal species)
#           Animal name (animal species)
#
#       Human_first_name Human_last_name
#           Animal name (animal species)

def print_directory():
    """Replace this with a good docstring."""

    # Replace this with your code


# 2. Write a function, find_humans_by_animal_species, which takes in an animal
#    species and *returns a list* of all of Human objects who have animals of
#    that species.

def find_humans_by_animal_species(species):
    """Replace this with a good docstring."""

    # Replace this with your code
